# Element Modules

A concept that illustrates the ability to write custom elements delaratively in
separate HTML files that can be `import`ed as "element modules".

This demo shows the rough behavior as expected by an end developer, and the
implementation is not realistic and has quirks and edge cases that a native
implementation will not have (see comments). It is only a concept to show the
rough idea.

To run, just clone, and statically serve the files (f.e. `npx five-server .`
with Node.js installed).
